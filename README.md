Face detection is a computer technology being used in a variety of applications that identifies
human faces in digital images. Human face detection by computer systems has become a major
field of interest. Most of the projects in image processing working on image only but we can
make real time face detector and we can also store the detected faces for further processing.
Face detection algorithms are used in a wide range of applications, such as security control,
video retrieving, biometric signal processing, human computer interface, face recognitions and
image database management. However, it is difficult to develop a complete robust face detector
due to various light conditions, face sizes, face orientations, background and skin color. In this
report, we propose a face detection method for color images. Our method detects skin regions
over the entire image, and then generates face candidates based on a connected component
analysis. We can use the viola jones algorithm to detect the faces in real time. We can detect
real time face on the video and create database of different faces
